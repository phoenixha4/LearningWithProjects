##### Conclusion

In this analysis, we built and evaluated three regression models: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and XGBRegressor. The performance of each model was assessed using the R-squared metric, which indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. Here are the results:

Linear Regression Model:

R-squared: 0.8799451660493708

Conclusion: The Linear Regression model explains approximately 88% of the variance in the target variable. This indicates a strong relationship between the features and the target, although there may still be some unexplained variability.

Lasso Regression Model:

R-squared: 0.8427856123435794

Conclusion: The Lasso Regression model explains approximately 84% of the variance in the target variable. While slightly lower than the Linear Regression model, Lasso may provide benefits such as feature selection and reducing overfitting by penalizing less significant features.

XGBRegressor Model:

R-squared: 0.999988239034454

Conclusion: The XGBRegressor model explains nearly 100% of the variance in the target variable. This exceptionally high R-squared value suggests that the model fits the training data extremely well. However, such a high value may also indicate overfitting, where the model performs exceptionally on the training data but may not generalize well to unseen data.

Overall Conclusion

The Linear Regression and Lasso Regression models both show strong performance with R-squared values around 88% and 84%, respectively. These models are relatively simple and interpretable, making them useful for understanding the relationships between the features and the target variable.

The XGBRegressor model demonstrates an almost perfect fit with an R-squared value close to 1. While this indicates excellent performance on the training data, it is crucial to validate this model using cross-validation or a separate test set to ensure it generalizes well and is not overfitting.

In practical applications, it is often a good idea to balance model complexity and interpretability. While complex models like XGBRegressor can capture intricate patterns in the data, simpler models like Linear and Lasso Regression can offer easier interpretation and insights into the data.
