### Conclusion

In this analysis, we developed and evaluated three regression models: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and XGBRegressor. We assessed each model's performance using the R-squared metric, which measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be predicted from the independent variables. Here are the results:

**Linear Regression Model:**

- **R-squared:** 0.8799451660493708
- **Conclusion:** The Linear Regression model accounts for approximately 88% of the variance in the target variable, indicating a strong relationship between the features and the target, though some variability remains unexplained.

**Lasso Regression Model:**

- **R-squared:** 0.8427856123435794
- **Conclusion:** The Lasso Regression model explains about 84% of the variance in the target variable. While slightly lower than the Linear Regression model, Lasso offers advantages such as feature selection and reducing overfitting by penalizing less significant features.

**XGBRegressor Model:**

- **R-squared:** 0.999988239034454
- **Conclusion:** The XGBRegressor model accounts for nearly 100% of the variance in the target variable, suggesting an exceptionally high fit to the training data. However, this might also indicate overfitting, where the model performs exceptionally well on training data but may not generalize effectively to new, unseen data.

### Overall Conclusion

Both the Linear Regression and Lasso Regression models demonstrate strong performance, with R-squared values around 88% and 84%, respectively. These models are relatively simple and interpretable, making them useful for understanding the relationships between features and the target variable.

The XGBRegressor model shows an almost perfect fit with an R-squared value close to 1. While this indicates excellent performance on the training data, it is crucial to validate this model using cross-validation or a separate test set to ensure it generalizes well and is not overfitting.

In practical applications, it is often beneficial to balance model complexity and interpretability. While complex models like XGBRegressor can capture intricate patterns in the data, simpler models like Linear and Lasso Regression can offer easier interpretation and insights into the data.
